               <p id="h">
                   Crayon Shin-chan is one of the biggest anime franchises of all time. The series has spanned over 20 years of constant production and has a level of popularity overseas that rivals The Simpsons. And yet, you’d be hard pressed to find many fans of it in most anime communities. It isn’t surprising: with the series as long as it is, it can be hard to know where to begin. This post will give a clear introduction to the series for those interested in trying it out.

                Shin-chan is a family cartoon in the style of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, King of the Hill, and others: it stars a middle class family’s daily life and their occasional run-ins with extraordinary, supernatural phenomenon. The appeal of these kinds of shows comes from the characters and the main family members here are all very endearin

                    He is the main character, son of Hiroshi and Misae. His nickname is "Shin-chan" Nohara and he is Himawari's brother, a kindergarten-aged boy whose antics are the basis for the series. He is often involved in a running gag of pulling down his pants to reveal his buttocks and dance in the process with an accompanying original song (known as "Ass dance" in the Funimation English dub). His affectionate name by relatives is Shin-chan. He is five years old and loves chocolate biscuits of the brand "Chocobi" and a TV superhero named "Action Mask", but he absolutely hates green peppers (acute lachanophobia). He always take care of his sister, Himawari. He inherited more genes from his mother than his father. He is lethargic, loves to eat and sleep, stingy, stubborn, imagining things, cannot resist good things, opinionated and brazen which is just like his mother while the only thing same with his father is likes to watch and flirt pretty young ladies. Both Shin-chan and his sister's appearance look more like their mother. He is a very good singer and pretty good baseball and football player. He learned photography from his aunt Musae. Sometimes he changes the actual words, making it very funny.
